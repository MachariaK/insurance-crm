# Design

The project has a user friendly interface with different role types for every user, each role gives type of directives that
help management to have more control over all of it. The designed types are:

Super User: all access
Owner: Access to see but not modify
Sells: Edit and apply changes to policies and it's dependents
Cashier: Access to Point of Sales and register payments.

## Policies and dependants.

Every insurance company in the world uses a system of policies and its dependents. Our CRM allows management
to have these two items separated but together, just as they are in the daily basis; also provides each one with time-lines for
payments understood on the CRM as "end_dates", which sets notifications on each end date for it to be paid.

## POS (Point Of Sales)
This one is  designed to be opened and closed by the cashier, every Open/close function creates a unique ID that helps
management tracking movements of daily income/outcome. If an user opens the POS, no other can use it while it has it.

## INSTALATION
As it is a Laravel Framework development with PHP, AngularJS and JQuery, you are gonna need to set up a Linux Server with Apache
to run it, also configure the Composer on it.

If need help configuring, contact us.
